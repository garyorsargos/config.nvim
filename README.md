# Neovim Dotfiles
### Initial Config Based on chris@machine's Guide
- This repo is an extension of chris@machine's Guide on creating a neovim config from scratch
- I have added additional functionality and edited keymaps, plugins, etc. to better fit my workflow
    - I mainly work with React, Docker, Python, and Lua

- Feel free to fork this repository and extend/edit it to your needs!
